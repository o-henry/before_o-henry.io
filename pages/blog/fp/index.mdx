FP programs often have fewer bugs, and the bugs that do exist are usually in more obvious places, so they're easier to find and fix. In other words, FP pattern is already well proven.

<br />

<h1> Readability </h1>

Fp is one of the most effective tools for crafting readable code.

<br />

<h1> Imperative </h1>

It’s focused on precisely instructing the computer how to do something.
You certainly can trace through its logic to see how the numbers flow and change to the end state, but It’s not at all clear or straightforward.

<br />

<h1> Declarative </h1>

FP is code that’s more focused on describing the what outcome.
The focus shifts from low-level how to higher level what outcomes.

<br />

<h1> Function </h1>

**In math, a function always takes input(s), and always gives an output.** That
means you should be using functions as mums as possible, and trying to avoid procedures
wherever possible.

Arguments
The values you pass in

Parameters
The named variables inside the function that receive those passed-in values

```jsx
import React from "react";

const CoolComponent = () => <div>I'm a cool component!!</div>;

export default CoolComponent;
```
